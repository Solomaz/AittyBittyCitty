A terrain generating audio visualization.

DEPENDANCIES:
Chrome WEBGL
p5.js
wamp (or presumably any local server, idk I needed to use for displaying images in chrome, maybe I'm doing it wrong...)

WHAT is this and HOW does it work?
This is a hobby project made for educational purposes.
Just a neat idea I wanted to learn how to implement.
It uses the Web Audio api to retrieve audio data.
Then, after allowing the browser to 'Use the Microphone'
and setting the audio device to use the Rec.Playback. (clicking the camera icon in the search bar for Chrome)
we can use any audio being played by our default audio device.
